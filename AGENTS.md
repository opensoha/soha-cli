# Soha CLI Repository Rules

## Scope

These rules apply to the entire `soha-cli` repository. Also follow the parent
workspace `AGENTS.md`. Before changing CLI behavior, read `README.md`, the
relevant workflow under `.github/workflows/`, and
`.agents/skills/soha-cli/SKILL.md`.

The executable sources of truth are:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for pull-request and `main` gates.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` for tagged artifacts, GitHub Releases, npm,
  and GHCR publishing.
- `internal/sohacli/command_metadata.go` for command discovery, help, generated
  docs, and completion metadata.
- Released `github.com/opensoha/soha-contracts` types for public API contracts.

When these rules disagree with an executable workflow, first determine whether
the workflow or documentation is stale, then update both in the same change.

## Ownership And Boundaries

- Keep `soha-cli` a standalone Go client. Do not import `soha/internal/**` or
  rely on a sibling core checkout at build or release time.
- Keep `go.mod` on a released `soha-contracts` version. Use an uncommitted local
  `go.work` only while coordinating unreleased contract changes.
- Keep Cloud-only lifecycle, billing, quota, and operations logic outside this
  repository. The CLI may call public Cloud APIs without owning their logic.
- Keep the npm package a checksum-verifying launcher for the native Go binary.
  Do not implement a second CLI or MCP server in JavaScript.
- Official agent-facing skills belong to `opensoha/soha-skills`. The CLI must
  install verified release assets rather than embed another copy.

## Implementation Invariants

- Preserve `Run(ctx, args, Runtime)` and injectable stdin, stdout, stderr,
  config path, clock, and HTTP clients. Only `cmd/soha/main.go` may bind process
  I/O directly.
- Use stdlib `flag` through the existing runtime flag helpers. Return errors
  from handlers and let `Run` map them to exit codes.
- Route HTTP work through existing focused clients and contracts DTOs. Test
  methods, paths, headers, payloads, refresh behavior, and error redaction.
- For every command-surface change, update command metadata, dispatch,
  completion hints where applicable, tests, and generated `docs/commands.md`.
- Keep `soha mcp` as the canonical stdio entry and `soha mcp start` compatible.
  Default to the official SaaS endpoint; persist an explicit `--base-url` for
  self-hosted client setup.
- Resolve the normal skill install/update path to the latest stable GitHub
  Release. Do not add a routine `--skills-version` flow. Explicit source pins
  remain available only for rollback and reproducible installs.

## Security Invariants

- Preserve `0700` profile directories and `0600` profile files.
- Never print full access tokens, refresh tokens, passwords, service-account
  tokens, plugin secrets, or authorization headers. Redact diagnostic output
  and test that failure messages do not leak secrets.
- Treat `SOHA_TOKEN` as an invocation-only override and never persist it.
- Refresh expired access tokens with the stored refresh token, persist rotated
  tokens atomically, and never send an Authorization header on refresh calls.
- Keep interactive passwords off stdout and disable terminal echo.
- Keep setup, skill, and plugin installation idempotent, path-safe, auditable,
  dry-run/check capable, and fail-closed on integrity errors.
- Keep GitHub skill downloads independent from Soha login. Never send a Soha
  bearer token to GitHub release endpoints.

## Change-To-Validation Matrix

| Change | Required focused validation |
| --- | --- |
| Command, flag, help, or completion | `Run` tests, metadata/docs regeneration, completion assertions |
| Profile, login, token refresh, or config | permission, atomic-write, refresh, redaction, and non-interactive tests |
| HTTP or contracts usage | `httptest.Server` request/response tests and `GOWORK=off` compatibility checks |
| MCP, setup, skills, or plugins | stdio/config fixtures, idempotency, `--dry-run`, `--check`, path safety, and integrity tests |
| npm launcher or release download | `npm test`, `npm pack --dry-run`, checksum/cache/tamper tests, and real tagged `npx` smoke |
| Dockerfile, module, CI, or release workflow | the complete CI gate plus a real Docker or corresponding successful Actions job |

## Complete CI Gate

Use Go `1.26.5`, Node.js `20.x`, `govulncheck v1.3.0`, and
`golangci-lint v2.9.0`. Run release-sensitive checks with the parent workspace
disabled:

```bash
GOWORK=off go mod tidy
git diff --exit-code -- go.mod go.sum
GOWORK=off go mod verify
GOWORK=off go test ./...
GOWORK=off go test -race ./...
GOWORK=off go vet ./...
GOWORK=off go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.3.0 ./...
golangci-lint run --timeout=5m
GOWORK=off CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /tmp/soha ./cmd/soha
(cd npm/cli && npm test && npm pack --dry-run)
docker build -f Dockerfile -t ghcr.io/opensoha/soha-cli:test .
git diff --check
```

Do not report a missing local tool or Docker daemon as a pass. For release work,
use the successful matching GitHub Actions job to complete verification. The
current `ci.yml` enforces the commands through the Docker build;
`git diff --check` is an additional mandatory local pre-submit check.

## Release Contract

- Treat a published semantic-version tag as immutable. Ship subsequent fixes
  under a new patch version rather than moving a public tag.
- Tag only a commit already merged to `main` with a successful matching
  `cli-ci` run. The packaging-focused Release workflow does not replace the
  complete race, vet, vulnerability, lint, npm, and Docker gate.
- Build six targets: Linux, macOS, and Windows on `amd64` and `arm64`.
- Publish exactly 13 custom GitHub assets: `checksums.txt`, six bare binaries,
  and six platform archives. GitHub's two source archives are additional.
- Inject version, commit, and UTC build date into every native binary. Verify
  the identity with `soha version --json`.
- Publish a non-draft, non-prerelease GitHub Release and verify the remote asset
  name set exactly. A green upload command without remote verification is not
  sufficient.
- Publish `@opensoha/cli` only after the GitHub Release exists. The npm version
  must equal the tag without the `v` prefix, use public provenance, and allow
  an idempotent retry when that exact version already exists.
- The launcher must download the matching bare binary and `checksums.txt`,
  enforce download bounds and HTTPS, verify SHA-256 before execution, and
  revalidate cached binaries.

Before declaring a release complete, require all of the following:

1. The tagged Release workflow and every dependent job succeed.
2. Anonymous requests can download `checksums.txt` and at least one native
   binary from the public GitHub Release.
3. `npm view @opensoha/cli@<version>` returns the expected version and
   provenance metadata.
4. A clean-cache `npx -y @opensoha/cli@<version> version --json` downloads,
   verifies, and executes the matching native binary.
5. For login, profile, MCP, setup, or delivery-tool changes, the released CLI
   logs in to a local Soha instance, preserves config permissions, and performs
   an authenticated `capabilities` call without exposing credentials.

## Working Tree Discipline

- Preserve unrelated local modifications and generated artifacts owned by the
  user. Stage only task-owned hunks.
- Do not hand-edit generated command docs, release archives, binaries, caches,
  or coverage output. Regenerate them through their owning command or workflow.
- Report validation precisely, including checks delegated to GitHub Actions and
  any integration path that was not exercised.
